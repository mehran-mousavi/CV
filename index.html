                    During my tenure as a Tech Lead, Software Architect, and Backend Developer, I undertook the task of
                    developing yiata.com, a cutting-edge multi-platform online travel booking engine. This experience,

                    impact on my professional journey.
                    To ensure the creation of an exceptional product, our team adopted the Scrum methodology, which
                    enabled us to efficiently manage the development process. Leveraging a versatile technical stack
                    comprising .Net Core, SQL, Redis, React, Flutter, AWS, and other innovative technologies, we crafted
                    a robust and seamless platform.
                    By assuming the role of Tech Lead, I spearheaded the project's technical direction, providing
                    strategic guidance and overseeing the implementation of architectural solutions. As a Software

                    remarkable endeavor not only offered me the chance to collaborate with a highly skilled team but
                    also left an indelible mark on my professional journey.
                    Our mission was to introduce a brand-new feature that would empower users to seamlessly reserve

                <p class="text-sm text-gray-300">

                    Throughout my career, I had the privilege of being involved in the development of SEPANTA ADSL CRM,
                    along with its associated subsystems like ADSL Billing and Core Accounting. This robust system
                    played a pivotal role in delivering reliable ADSL internet services to users of Iran's esteemed
                    telecommunications organization across multiple provinces.
                    In my capacity, I worked closely with our Team Leader to comprehend the specific requirements of
                    stakeholders, ensuring that the system catered to their unique needs. By collaborating with fellow
                    developers and team members, we embarked on a journey to conceive and implement innovative solutions
                    that prioritized user-friendliness, efficiency, and scalability.
                    The experience of working on the SEPANTA project proved to be immensely rewarding, as it allowed me
                    to showcase my expertise and contribute to its resounding success. With a shared commitment to
                    excellence, we overcame challenges, pushed boundaries, and delivered a system that elevated the
                    experience of ADSL internet users throughout the organization.
                    From conceptualization to implementation, every step of the development process demanded meticulous
                    attention to detail and a deep understanding of the telecommunications landscape. Through our
                    collective efforts, we not only met the expectations of stakeholders but also exceeded them,
                    offering an exceptional solution that streamlined operations and improved customer satisfaction.
                    Looking back, I am proud of the invaluable contributions I made to the SEPANTA project. The lessons
                    learned from this experience have fortified my commitment to pursuing excellence in software
                    development and have equipped me with a broader perspective on the intricate dynamics of large-scale
                    systems. I carry the memories of SEPANTA as a testament to the power of collaboration, innovation,
                    and the pursuit of customer-centric solutions.

                <p class="text-blue-400 text-sm mb-2 font-semibold">Freelance (Oct 2006 – Dec 2010)</p>
                <p class="text-sm text-gray-300">
                    In addition to pursuing my Academic education, I also had the opportunity to work as a freelancer,
                    collaborating with a diverse range of clients to hone my skills, gain valuable experience, and earn
                    money. Working as a freelancer allowed me to expand my horizons and work on exciting projects
                    outside the boundaries of traditional employment.
                    I worked on various projects, ranging from web development to mobile app development and software
                    architecture, all of which presented unique challenges and opportunities to learn. Collaborating
                    with clients from diverse backgrounds and industries enabled me to broaden my perspective, think
                    critically, and approach problems from different angles.
                    Throughout my time as a freelancer, I leveraged my skills and knowledge to deliver high-quality
                    solutions that met the unique needs of each client. I worked diligently to understand their
                    requirements, communicate effectively, and deliver solutions that exceeded their expectations.
                    The experience of working as a freelancer was invaluable, as it allowed me to develop essential
                    skills such as time management, communication, and problem-solving. I learned to balance competing
                    priorities, manage deadlines, and work effectively as part of a team, all of which have proven to be
                    invaluable assets in my career.
                    Overall, my experience as a freelancer was both enriching and rewarding. I am grateful for the
                    opportunities it provided me to learn, grow, and collaborate with a diverse range of clients. The
                    experience has shaped my approach to software development and reinforced my commitment to delivering
                    exceptional solutions that exceed client expectations.
